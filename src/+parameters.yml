publish-token-variable:
  description: >
    the env var containing your publish token. Pass this as a literal string such
    as `$ORB_PUBLISHING_TOKEN`. DO NOT paste the actual token into your
    configuration. If omitted it's assumed the CLI has already been setup
    with a valid token.
    By default, an environment variable `$ORB_PUBLISHING_TOKEN` is expected.
    Make sure to pass a context to this job that contains the variable.
