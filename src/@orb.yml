version: 2.1

description: >
  This version of the orb tools provides extended functions to the upstream version.
  First, you can use environment variables from the envorb, e.g., for version tagging.
  Second, you can use placeholders in your yaml files that are patched by environment variables.
  Third, you can reduce the overhead of your orbs' parameters by using cross-cutting paramters.
  Simply define your parameters in your +parameters.yml file and they are propagated to the files where they are
  referenced during the build.

orbs:
  envorb: gofunky/envorb@0.3.9
  orb-tools: circleci/orb-tools@2.0.2
